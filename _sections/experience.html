        For a research project, I was in charge to value data from 911 call
        center. I used <strong>PyTorch</strong> and
        <strong>scikit-learn</strong> to train <strong>LSTM</strong> and
        <strong>Decision trees</strong> models for police event prediction
        (crime, bulgaries), that are 19% more accurate than seasonal methods.

        My mission at Thales was multiple: from building a
        <strong>new qualification process</strong> that saved weeks for each
        software release, to <strong>harmonizing tools</strong> used by multiple
        enginiering teams. I worked mainly on <strong>C++</strong> and
        <strong>Java</strong> codebase.
