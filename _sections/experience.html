        Developed <strong>GUI application</strong> in Python which controls a a
        power distribution test module. I developed the PCB schematics and
        layout for the control board which integrated a 32 Bit
        <strong>ARM-based M3 Microcontroller </strong>, also contributing to
        firmware updates for the STM32 series chip.

        Collaborated with an eight-member cross-functional team, spanning two
        time zones (Portland and Ho Chi Minh City), to develop a
        <strong>PCB</strong> interfacing to Ampere's SOC thermal test system,
        resulting in <strong>thousands</strong> per-unit cost savings.
        Additionally, contributed to the creation of the company's first cost
        model tool, providing configurable and precise cost assessments for the
        latest SOC validation systems and configurations.
